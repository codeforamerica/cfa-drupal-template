## Drush Make and Installing ##

It is much more sustainable to maintain a Drush Make file for a Drupal template.  Read up about Drush and Drush Make here:

## Approach ##

The overall approach to this should be the following:

 * Create a Make File that includes all the parts to download
 * Create separate Profiles for different combinations of modules and features.

## Coding Standards ##

Drupal has its own [coding styles](http://drupal.org/coding-standards) for PHP, JS, CSS, etc.  Please follow when writing new Drupal modules.
